# Staged bytecode VM for the Rust runtime — milestone 1 design

Working design note for GitHub issue #195. Non-normative: it does not change
the portable HAL contract in `specs/`; it describes how the Rust runtime
implements that contract for a small synchronous subset. For the areas it
covers, the normative successor is now
`specs/01-lang/010-bytecode/draft/hal-bytecode-vm.edn` (with its machine-checked corpus in
`specs/01-lang/010-bytecode/draft/conformance/bytecode-vm.edn`); where this note and that
spec disagree, the spec wins.

Status: milestone 4 in progress (globals, namespaces, and arity; §19).
Milestone 3 delivered closures, defn lowering, and exception handling. The
VM is disabled by default behind the `bytecode-vm` Cargo feature and never
replaces `Runtime::eval_native`. Milestone 1 covered the closure-free
synchronous subset, §17 records the milestone 2 delta, §18 records the
milestone 3 delta (exceptions), and §19 records the milestone 4 design
(globals, defstruct, variadic and multi-arity functions).

## 1. Execution model

A synchronous stack machine. Compilation is a separate, explicit stage:

```text
source ──parse──▶ SpannedForm ──compile──▶ Program ──validate──▶ execute ──▶ Value
```

- The compiler accepts the already-read `Form` tree (no macros, no namespace
  rewriting) and emits a typed instruction program.
- The validator checks the program once, before any execution.
- The machine interprets the validated program to completion or failure.
  There is no suspension, yielding, or resumption in this milestone; the
  dispatch loop is one `match` over instructions inside `Machine::run`.
- Unsupported forms are compile-time errors. The VM never falls back to the
  tree-walking evaluator, so benchmark and differential numbers stay honest.

## 2. Program and function representation

```rust
pub struct Program {
    pub constants: Vec<Value>,          // literal pool, reuses core::Value directly
    pub functions: Vec<FunctionPrototype>,
    pub entry: FunctionId,              // index into `functions`
}

pub struct FunctionPrototype {
    pub name: Option<String>,
    pub arity: u16,                     // 0 for the entry function in this milestone
    pub local_count: u16,               // slot array size
    pub max_stack: u16,                 // declared operand-stack high-water mark
    pub code: Vec<Instruction>,
    pub source_map: SourceMap,          // per-instruction source positions
}
```

Milestone 1 emits exactly one prototype (the entry function). The
`functions`/`entry` structure exists now so the closure milestone can add
prototypes without changing `Program`.

Constants are `core::Value` directly. The alternative — a parallel VM value
model — was rejected: it would duplicate the value hierarchy the issue
explicitly forbids duplicating, and `Value` is already portable across native
and `wasm32` (it is the same type the wasm browser build uses).

## 3. Instruction encoding

A typed Rust enum, not packed bytes:

```rust
pub enum Instruction {
    Constant(u32),                    // push constants[i]
    Nil,                              // push Value::Nil
    True,                             // push Value::Bool(true)
    False,                            // push Value::Bool(false)
    LoadLocal(u16),                   // push locals[slot]
    StoreLocal(u16),                  // pop into locals[slot]
    Pop,                              // discard top
    Primitive { op: Primitive, argc: u8 }, // pop argc, push result
    Jump(u32),                        // ip = target
    JumpIfFalse(u32),                 // pop; if not truthy, ip = target
    Return,                           // return top of stack (height must be 1)
}
```

Deviation from the issue's suggested surface, deliberately: instead of ten
binary arithmetic/comparison opcodes there is one variadic
`Primitive { op, argc }` instruction. Hara's `+ - * / % mod = < <= > >=` are
variadic (`(+ 1 2 3)`, `(< 1 2 3)`) with defined fold order and exact error
messages ("integer overflow", "division by zero", "+ expects numbers",
"< expects at least two arguments"). Folding variadic calls into binary
chains in the compiler would duplicate that behavior (and get `(< 1 2 3)`
wrong without extra short-circuit machinery). `Primitive` pops `argc` values
and hands them to the shared `core::apply_primitive` boundary (§8), so the VM
inherits the exact semantics. `argc: u8` caps calls at 255 arguments; the
compiler rejects larger arities.

A packed-byte encoding is a later optimization; the typed enum keeps
validation and disassembly exact and does not preclude a `&[u8]` view later.

## 4. Operand stack behavior

- One operand stack per machine (per frame in later milestones).
- Every instruction has a statically known stack effect:
  push +1 (`Constant`, `Nil`, `True`, `False`, `LoadLocal`), pop −1 (`Pop`,
  `StoreLocal`, `JumpIfFalse`), net `1 − argc` (`Primitive`), 0 (`Jump`),
  terminal (`Return`).
- `JumpIfFalse` consumes the condition; both `if` branches then produce
  exactly one value, so control-flow joins are height-consistent by
  construction.
- The machine runs with a `Vec<Value>` stack and never allocates per
  instruction; primitive arguments are gathered into a reused scratch buffer.
- The validator computes the exact stack height at every instruction and
  verifies the declared `max_stack` (§9).

## 5. Lexical slot allocation

Locals are numeric slots in a fixed-size `Vec<Value>` allocated at frame
entry (initialized to `Nil`). No string-keyed maps at runtime.

- The compiler keeps a scope stack. Each `let`/`loop` pushes a scope; every
  binding name maps to a fresh slot.
- Slots are monotonically allocated while a scope is open and freed (the
  high-water counter rewinds) when the scope closes, so sibling scopes reuse
  slots. `local_count` is the maximum simultaneously live slots.
- Shadowing allocates a new slot in the inner scope; name resolution searches
  scopes innermost-first, so the inner binding wins and the outer slot is
  untouched.
- `let` initializers compile in order; each name enters the scope only after
  its initializer is compiled, so a later initializer observes earlier
  bindings (current Hara behavior) but not later ones.
- Scope restore is compile-time only (pop the scope stack); the runtime does
  no environment save/restore, unlike the current evaluator's
  `Rc<RefCell<HashMap>>` cloning.
- Destructuring binding patterns are out of scope: a non-symbol binding name
  is a compile error.

## 6. Branch and jump semantics

- Jump operands are absolute instruction indexes (`u32`), patched by the
  compiler once target positions are known.
- `JumpIfFalse` pops the condition and branches when the value is not truthy.
  Truthiness is exactly `Value::truthy`: only `nil` and `false` are false.
- The validator rejects out-of-range targets and targets that would land
  with inconsistent stack heights (§9).

`if` lowering:

```text
  <condition>
  JumpIfFalse Lelse
  <then>
  Jump Lend
Lelse:
  <else>          ; or `Nil` when the else branch is missing
Lend:
```

`(if c t)` compiles the missing else as `Nil`, matching the evaluator.

## 7. `loop/recur` compilation

`loop` compiles like `let` (ordered binding initializers into fresh slots),
then records a loop context: the header instruction index (first body
instruction) and the binding slot list. Multiple body forms sequence like
`do` — matching the current evaluator, which wraps `body+` in `do` — and
the last form compiles in the loop's tail position.

`recur` with `n` arguments against loop slots `[s0 .. sn-1]`:

```text
  <arg0> <arg1> ... <argN-1>     ; all evaluated before any store
  StoreLocal sN-1                ; stores in reverse order
  ...
  StoreLocal s0
  Jump header
```

Because every argument is evaluated (loaded) before the first `StoreLocal`,
simultaneous-recurrence semantics hold: a new value never observes a
partially updated binding set. Reverse-order storing is what makes the
sequence correct when arg evaluation itself reads loop slots.

Compile-time rejections (mirroring `hal-langspec.edn` `:eval/recur-tail`,
which states recur is valid only in tail position with matching arity):

- `recur` with no enclosing loop: "recur must be inside loop".
- arity mismatch: "loop recur arity mismatch".
- `recur` not in tail position of its loop body: compile error. Tail
  positions are: the loop body, the branches of a tail `if`, the last form of
  a tail `do` or `let` body. Everything else (initializers, conditions,
  primitive arguments, non-final `do` forms) is non-tail.
- `recur` is compiled to jumps, never to a `Value::Recur` payload — the VM
  does not represent recur as a value or exception.

This is a deliberate, spec-aligned tightening over the current evaluator,
which detects some misuse only at runtime; both paths error, and the
differential tests compare error categories (§15).

## 8. Primitive dispatch

Arithmetic and comparison semantics are **not** reimplemented in the VM.
`core.rs` gains a small value-level boundary, shared with the existing
evaluator:

```rust
pub enum Primitive { Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide, Remainder,
                     Equal, Less, LessOrEqual, Greater, GreaterOrEqual }

pub(crate) fn apply_primitive(primitive: Primitive, arguments: &[Value])
    -> Result<Value, String>;
```

The existing `arithmetic`/`comparison`/`=` arms of `core::eval` are re-pointed
at `apply_primitive` after evaluating their argument forms, so there is one
implementation of:

- i64-only arithmetic with `checked_*` ops ("integer overflow",
  "division by zero", "{op} expects numbers", "{op} expects arguments");
  `mod` and `%` share the `%` operator spelling in error messages;
- chained variadic comparisons ("< expects at least two arguments");
- `=` via the existing `PartialEq for Value` ("= expects at least 2 arguments").

The machine pops `argc` values into a scratch buffer and calls
`apply_primitive` directly. No forms are cloned, no temporary symbols or
environments are built.

## 9. Validation rules

`validate(&Program)` runs before any execution and rejects:

- empty code, or code that does not end in an executed `Return`;
- `Constant` indexes outside `constants`;
- `LoadLocal`/`StoreLocal` slots outside `local_count`;
- jump targets outside the code vector;
- any instruction unreachable from index 0 (the compiler emits no dead code;
  unreachable code in a hand-built program is malformed);
- stack underflow along any path;
- inconsistent stack heights at control-flow joins (every instruction must
  have one unique height);
- `Return` at a stack height other than exactly 1;
- programs exceeding defined limits: `MAX_CONSTANTS` (2^24),
  `MAX_INSTRUCTIONS` (2^24), `MAX_LOCALS` (2^16 − 1, inherent to `u16`),
  `MAX_OPERAND_STACK` (4096);
- a declared `max_stack` that disagrees with the computed high-water mark.

Validation is a single abstract-interpretation pass carrying stack heights
across a worklist of instruction indexes. After it passes, the machine
indexes without re-checking; malformed programs produce `ValidationError`,
never panics.

## 10. Source maps and diagnostics

The compiler works on `kernel::parser::read_forms` output (`SpannedForm`)
and records the `Position` (offset, line, column) of the originating form
for every emitted instruction. `SourceMap` is a parallel
`Vec<Option<Position>>` indexed by instruction offset.

- Compile errors carry the form's position and render like parse errors:
  `message [line L, column C]`.
- Runtime errors (`VmError`) carry the failing instruction index and its
  source position, rendered the same way.
- The disassembler prints offsets, operands, constant previews, jump
  destinations, and source positions deterministically.

## 11. Native/WASM constraints

- No new dependencies. The VM uses `core::Value`, `kernel::Form`, and the
  parser — all already wasm-compatible.
- No `unsafe`, no host-specific machinery, no threads, no floating-point
  reinterpretation beyond what `Value` already does.
- All indexing safety comes from the validator; the machine uses checked
  indexing that converts validator-covered failures into `VmError`s rather
  than panicking.
- Verified with `cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --features
  bytecode-vm --lib`.

## 12. Closures and upvalues (delivered in milestone 2)

Milestone 2 (§17) delivered function values, by-value captures, and
direct/static calls without upvalue load/store instructions: captures are
copied into prefixed local slots at closure creation, so the existing
`LoadLocal`/`StoreLocal` machinery covers them.

- `Program.functions` holds one prototype per `fn`/`defn` body;
  `closure.rs` remains deliberately absent (no separate upvalue
  representation was needed).
- `Frame` (locals + stack base + return address) gives the machine a call
  stack; `Closure` values wrap a nested `Machine` through the shared
  `core::native_function` boundary.
- `recur` across a function boundary stays rejected; the loop context stack
  is per-prototype.

## 13. Exception handling (delivered in milestone 3)

Milestone 3 (§18) delivered `try`/`catch`/`finally` and guest `throw` using
the per-prototype handler table sketched below. The original sketch is kept
for reference.

`try/catch/finally` needs protected ranges on the code vector: a handler
table (`Vec<(start, end, handler_ip)>`) per prototype, plus stack-unwind
logic in the machine. The source map and validator already treat the code
vector as the single source of truth, so the table attaches cleanly. Out of
scope here; the machine's error type is designed to carry the instruction
index a handler table would need.

## 14. Future suspension and resumability

`VmOutcome` is the seam:

```rust
pub enum VmOutcome { Returned(Value), Failed(VmError) }
```

Later milestones add `Suspended(continuation)` variants. Because the machine
state is plain data (ip, stack, locals, frame), suspending means serializing
or parking that state — no CPS transform of the instruction set is needed.
The dispatch loop is a `loop { match ... }` that can return at any point, so
adding suspension does not rewrite instruction dispatch, only adds exit
points. This mirrors how `fiber.rs` already separates `Step` state from
driving.

## 15. Coexistence with the current evaluator

- The VM is additive: new `rust/src/vm.rs` + `rust/src/vm/*` modules, a
  `bytecode-vm` feature (non-default), and feature-gated free functions:

  ```rust
  pub fn compile_bytecode(source: &str) -> Result<Rc<vm::Program>, String>;
  pub fn execute_bytecode(program: &Rc<vm::Program>) -> Result<String, String>;
  pub fn eval_bytecode_native(source: &str) -> Result<String, String>;
  ```

  Programs are returned inside `Rc` because compiled closures share the
  program with their executing machines.
- `Runtime::eval_native` and the fiber/`core::eval` path are unchanged in
  behavior. The only `core.rs` edit is extracting `apply_primitive` (§8),
  which the existing evaluator also calls — semantics shared, not forked.
- `eval_bytecode_native` accepts only closed, namespace-independent forms:
  literals, lexical locals, the ten primitives, `if`, `do`, `let`,
  `loop/recur`, `fn` values with by-value captures, calls to function
  values, `defn` as a lowered top-level statement, `()` (nil), metadata
  passthrough, and big-integer/decimal/regex literals as constants.
  Everything else (symbols that are not locals or lowered defns, `def`,
  `quote`, collections as runtime constructors — deferred, protocols,
  `try`, promises, namespaces) is a typed compile error. No silent
  fallback.
- Differential tests run each supported source through `Runtime::eval_native`
  and the VM and compare displayed values, or normalized error categories
  when the two paths legitimately phrase errors differently (compile-time vs
  runtime detection of recur misuse).

## 16. Conditions required before making the VM the default

Not in this milestone. Minimum bar for a later default-on discussion:

1. ~~Closures/upvalues~~ (milestone 2), multi-arity calls, and namespace
   interop compiled, so real programs (not just closed arithmetic) run.
2. Differential parity over the Core-language conformance corpus
   (`specs/01-lang/001-language/draft/conformance/core.edn`), not only the milestone
   subset.
3. Exception and suspension stories (§13, §14) implemented or proven
   unnecessary per call site.
4. Execute-only benchmarks showing a real win over the fiber evaluator on
   the `lib/bench/runtime/workloads.json` corpus, with compile cost
   amortized by caching.
5. A fallback strategy for forms the VM still rejects, decided explicitly
   (hybrid dispatch vs full coverage).

## Open decisions recorded at milestone 1

- `Primitive { op, argc }` instead of ten binary opcodes (§3).
- `recur` misuse is a compile error, not a runtime error (§7) — matches the
  langspec, differs in phrasing from the current evaluator.
- Constant pool stores `Value` directly (§2) — no duplication of the value
  model.
- Collection literals deferred even though the evaluator supports them;
  adding them later is additive (`Vector`, `Map`, `Set` construction
  instructions or primitives) and does not change this milestone's
  instruction semantics.

## 17. Milestone 2 — closures, calls, and defn lowering

Scope (GitHub issue #202): `fn` values, lexical captures, direct calls,
and `defn` lowering. Still synchronous; still feature-gated; exceptions
(#203) and suspension (#204) remain future work.

### 17.1 Instruction additions

```rust
Closure { prototype: u32, captures: u8 }, // pop captures, push fn value
Call { argc: u8 },                        // pop argc args + callee, push result
CallStatic { prototype: u32, argc: u8 },  // pop argc args, push result
```

`FunctionPrototype` gains `capture_count`; capture slots are pre-allocated
as locals `arity .. arity + capture_count - 1`, so a function body reads
its captured environment through ordinary `LoadLocal`s. There are no
upvalue instructions and no `closure.rs`. Validation additionally rejects:
bad closure/callstatic prototype indexes, capture-count mismatches
between the closure instruction and the prototype, callstatic arity
mismatches, and programs exceeding `MAX_CAPTURES` (255).

### 17.2 Compiler: context stack and free-variable pre-pass

The compiler was restructured from one flat function context into a
context stack: constants and the prototype table are shared across the
whole program, while each function under construction gets its own scope
stack, loop contexts, jump patches, and source map. Compiling a nested
`fn` pushes a fresh context; closing it appends a finished prototype.

Captures are computed by a free-variable pre-pass (`collect_free`) over
the `fn` body: symbols referenced but not bound within the function
(params, let's, loops, nested fn params bind; special-form and primitive
operators are not references) resolve against the enclosing context's
scope stack. Each captured name is declared as a slot in the new function
before its body compiles, and the enclosing function emits the matching
`LoadLocal`s before `Closure`. Captures are **by value at closure-creation
time**; nested closures capture through intermediate scopes because the
intermediate function's capture slots are themselves resolvable names.

### 17.3 Machine: calls through the shared function boundary

The machine holds `Rc<Program>` and a `Frame` per active call (locals,
operand-stack base, return address). `Closure` copies the capture values
into a new frame's prefixed slots and wraps the prototype in
`core::native_function`, producing an ordinary `Value::Function` whose
invocation runs a nested machine. `Call` dispatches through the shared
`core::call_function` boundary, so arity errors ("function expects 1
arguments"), `<fn>` display, and non-function callees ("value is not
callable") behave exactly as in the evaluator — the VM does not
reimplement them. `CallStatic` skips the callee value entirely for
compiler-known targets (defn calls and self-recursion).

Consequence: recursion depth is bounded by the host stack (nested
machines), not by the fiber's trampoline. The evaluator reaches depth
10000 on self-recursion; the corpus keeps VM recursion at depth ≤ 1000.
Deep-recursion support belongs to the suspension milestone (#204), where
a real call stack replaces nested machines.

### 17.4 defn lowering

The evaluator's `defn` materializes a Var and mutates the namespace; the
VM has neither. For the closed, namespace-independent subset, `defn`
**lowers to a direct slot binding**, matching the evaluator's observable
early-binding behavior:

- Legal only as a non-final top-level statement (a top-level `do` is
  transparent for statement position). Result-position defn errors with
  "defn in result position requires var semantics"; nested defn with
  "defn is only supported as a top-level statement".
- The name binds a slot holding the function value; calls compile to
  `CallStatic`. Self-recursion compiles to a `CallStatic` self-call.
- Redefinition shadows the earlier binding (early binding means later
  forms see the new slot; already-compiled bodies keep the old one),
  matching the evaluator.
- Forward references fail as "unbound symbol", matching the evaluator.
- Foundation replacement follows namespace ownership (§17.5).
- Referencing the defn'd name as a value inside its own body errors with
  "defn self-reference in value position is not supported"; `#'f` remains
  "unsupported operator: var".
- Variadic (`&`) and multi-arity `fn`/`defn` use explicit prototype metadata
  and dispatch bytecodes. Parameter destructuring is lowered to binding
  bytecodes, including nested sequential and map patterns.

### 17.5 Superseded ruling: namespace ownership

Milestone 4 supersedes the issue-#202 declare-or-error experiment. Ordinary
callables are Vars and a namespace may define only names that it owns:

```hara
(ns protected)
(declare count) ; error: referred std.foundation/count is protected

(ns local-count
  (:config {:blank true})
  (:require [std.foundation :refer :all :exclude [count]]))
(defn count [n] 42)
(count 5) ; => 42
```

- `(declare name ...)` supplies forward visibility for a namespace-owned
  name and evaluates to nil. It never grants permission to replace a
  referred Var.
- `def`, `defn`, `defmacro`, `declare`, and `set!` enforce the same ownership
  boundary on Java, the Rust evaluator, and the VM.
- Callable resolution is lexical binding, visible Var, then an internal
  primitive fallback. True syntax alone retains structural dispatch.
- `:config {:blank true}` clears referrals; `:require :exclude` is
  idempotent and removes a matching existing referral before imports are
  published.

### 17.6 Error surface additions

New corpus error categories (pinned in
`specs/01-lang/010-bytecode/draft/conformance/bytecode-vm.edn`): "function arity",
"not callable", "fn params shape". Call arity and callability errors are
runtime errors carrying instruction index and source position; shape and
lowering errors are compile errors.

### 17.7 Benchmarks (milestone 2, arm64, rustc 1.97.1)

Median per call, 15 windows; raw JSON in `rust/target/vm-bench/`

Interpretation:

- The machine refactor (frames, `Rc<Program>`, capture pre-pass) did not
  regress the milestone-1 loop path: arithmetic execute-only holds at
  ~534 µs (~57× over the evaluator).
- Function calls are where the evaluator's costs (environment cloning,
  boxed continuations, form reconstruction) concentrate: 2500 nested
  `((fn [x] (+ x 1)) acc)` calls per loop take ~457 ms there vs ~752 µs
  here — ~600×. Compile cost is noise at this workload size
  (compile+execute ≈ execute-only), so for closed hot code, caching a
  compiled program is not yet the deciding factor; execution is.
- No performance threshold is asserted in CI; these are evidence for the
  issue, not gates.

## Open decisions recorded at milestone 2

- Captures as prefixed local slots instead of an upvalue representation
  (§17.1) — simpler validator and machine; revisit only if mutation of
  shared captured state is ever required (Hara values are persistent, so
  by-value capture matches language semantics).
- `Closure` values wrap nested machines through `core::native_function`
  (§17.3) — maximal reuse of the shared call boundary at the cost of a
  host-stack recursion bound; the suspension milestone replaces this with
  an explicit call stack.
- defn lowering instead of Var materialization (§17.4) — closed-world
  subset only; namespace-interop programs still need the evaluator.

## 18. Milestone 3 — exception handling (issue #203)

Milestone 3 compiles `try`/`catch`/`finally` and guest `throw`. The design
reuses the evaluator's error identity semantics exactly: errors in flight
remain plain message strings, and the guest-thrown value rides the existing
`ACTIVE_THROWN_VALUE` side channel in `core.rs`. The machine calls
`core::thrown_error`, `core::catch_matches`, and `core::caught_error`
verbatim; no identity logic is reimplemented in the VM.

### 18.1 Handler representation: per-prototype try table

Handlers are static exception-table entries on the function prototype, not
a dynamic handler stack:

```rust
pub struct TryEntry {
    pub start: u32,              // protected range [start, end)
    pub end: u32,
    pub depth: u16,              // operand height at try entry (patched after analysis)
    pub catches: Vec<CatchEntry>,// source order, first match wins
    pub finally: Option<u32>,    // finally region address
    pub pending_value: Option<u16>, // hidden slot: result or error message
    pub pending_error: Option<u16>, // hidden slot: Bool(error-pending)
}

pub struct CatchEntry {
    pub class: String,           // "Exception" for the implicit 3-form
    pub binding: u16,            // clause binding slot
    pub target: u32,             // clause code address
}
```

Tables beat a dynamic handler stack (`PushHandler`/`PopHandler`
instructions) for this machine: control may leave a protected range through
ordinary jumps (`if` branches out of a body, `recur` through a catch-only
`try`) without any runtime bookkeeping, and the validator can check every
handler field statically. The unwind search walks the table in reverse
registration order, which is innermost-first because the compiler registers
an outer `try` before any `try` inside its body.

### 18.2 New instructions

- `Throw` — pops one value, raises via `core::thrown_error` (message
  `thrown: <display>`, side channel set). Terminal.
- `Rethrow` — pops one value, which must be a string, and raises that exact
  message *without* touching the side channel. Terminal. Only emitted in
  finally resume sequences: it preserves error identity across an unmatched
  `finally` boundary, so an outer `catch` still matches the original class
  and binds the original value.

### 18.3 Unwind semantics

Every failure site in the machine (primitive errors, call errors, machine
defenses) and the two new instructions route through `raise(message)`:

1. Find the innermost table entry whose range covers the failing ip.
2. Try each catch clause in source order with `core::catch_matches`
   (`Exception`/`Throwable` match everything; any other class matches only
   a thrown struct by type name or `/`-suffix). On the first match the
   machine truncates the operand stack to `entry.depth`, stores
   `core::caught_error(&message)` into the binding slot, and jumps to the
   clause target. The side channel is consumed only after a match is
   decided, exactly like the evaluator's `finish_try`.
3. No match, `finally` present: truncate, store the message string into
   `pending_value`, store `true` into `pending_error`, jump to the finally
   region. The side channel is left intact for outer handlers.
4. No match, no `finally`: propagate `VmError` with the original message
   and the original failing instruction's source position.

Because catch and finally regions lie outside their entry's protected
range, a throw inside a catch clause or a finally body unwinds to the next
outer entry — matching the evaluator. A finally body that throws therefore
replaces the pending result, matching the fiber evaluator (first finally
error short-circuits). The older synchronous `core::eval` path runs all
finally forms and lets the last error win; that path is a deprecated
fallback and the VM follows the fiber, which is the primary evaluator.

### 18.4 Code layout

Catch-only `try` (entry height H):

```text
    <body>                    ; protected [start, end), H -> H+1
    Jump after
catch_i:                      ; unwind lands here with stack truncated to H
    <clause body>             ; binding slot pre-stored by the machine
    Jump after
after:                        ; height H+1
```

`try` with `finally` adds two hidden slots (allocated by a new
`ScopeStack::declare_hidden`, never name-resolvable):

```text
    False; StoreLocal pe      ; default: no error pending
start:
    <body>
    StoreLocal pv; Jump finally
end:
catch_i:
    <clause body>
    StoreLocal pv; Jump finally
finally:                      ; reached from every path at height H
    <finally forms, all results popped>
    LoadLocal pe
    JumpIfFalse normal
    LoadLocal pv; Rethrow     ; unmatched error resumes its flight
normal:
    LoadLocal pv              ; the try's value
```

`finally` runs on the normal path, the caught path, and the unmatched
rethrow path; its own value is discarded. Regions that cannot be reached
because the body or a clause ends in `Throw`/`recur` are simply not
emitted, following the existing `fallthrough` discipline.

### 18.5 Catch clause shapes and errors

The compiler mirrors the fiber's shapes: `(catch name body)` (exactly 3
elements, symbol name) is the implicit `Exception` clause;
`(catch Class name body...)` dispatches on a class symbol. Multiple
`finally` clauses concatenate, and clause groups may appear in any order
after the body — both verified against the evaluator.

Malformed clauses are compile errors, with the fiber's message spellings:
`try clauses must follow body`, `catch expects class, name, and body`,
`catch class must be symbol`, `catch name must be symbol`. This is the
recur-misuse precedent applied to `try`: compile-time rejection is
canonical. Two observable divergences result, recorded here:

- `(try 1 (catch 42 e 0))` evaluates to `1` in the evaluator (the malformed
  clause is only inspected on the throwing path, and then silently treated
  as non-matching); the VM rejects it at compile time.
- `throw` arity errors (`throw` expects one value) are runtime errors in
  the evaluator, compile errors in the VM; both phrases match.

### 18.6 recur and try

With a table, `recur` through a catch-only `try` needs no runtime support:
the `Jump` to the loop header simply leaves the protected range. The
compiler propagates tail position into catch-only `try` bodies and clause
bodies, so `(loop [i 0] (try (if (< i 3) (recur (+ i 1)) i) (catch
Exception e -1)))` compiles and evaluates to `3`, matching the evaluator
(verified).

`recur` crossing a `finally` boundary is rejected at compile time:
`recur cannot cross a finally boundary`. The evaluator runs the `finally`
on every recur crossing (verified: `(loop [i 0] (try (if (< i 3) (recur (+
i 1)) i) (finally (throw 99))))` fails with `thrown: 99`), and correctly
supporting that requires either scoped code duplication or a resume-action
protocol that can also chain through nested finally regions and multiple
enclosing loops. That machinery belongs to the frame-stack milestone,
where unwinding is first-class; until then the VM is explicit rather than
wrong. This is a recorded divergence in the same class as the defn-lowering
restrictions.

### 18.7 Validation additions

- `Throw`/`Rethrow` require stack height at least 1 and have no successors.
- Every `TryEntry`: `start < end <= code.len()`; catch targets, the finally
  target, and all slots in range; `depth` must equal the computed height at
  `start`; pending slots present exactly when a finally target is present.
- Handler targets are seeded into the worklist analysis with the height
  computed at their entry's `start`, so the ordinary join-consistency rule
  covers them.
- Two try ranges must be disjoint or strictly nested; partial overlap is
  rejected (`try ranges must not partially overlap`).

### 18.8 Cross-boundary message fix

Milestone 2's `Closure` callback converted a nested machine's `VmError`
with `error.to_string()`, decorating the message with position and
instruction suffixes before it crossed the `call_function` boundary. Guest
values survived (the side channel prefix-match still held), but a runtime
error caught across a closure boundary bound the decorated string instead
of the bare message. Milestone 3 passes `error.message` through, matching
`CallStatic` and the evaluator.

### 18.9 Conformance additions

New corpus cases in `bytecode-vm.edn` (`:display` unless noted):

- `error/catch-guest-value` — the core-language case verbatim: 42.
- `error/catch-first-match` — first matching clause wins.
- `error/catch-implicit-form` — `(catch error error)` binds the keyword.
- `error/catch-binds-runtime-string` — `(/ 1 0)` binds `"division by zero"`.
- `error/unmatched-class` — `:error-category "thrown"`; the core-language
  `error/unmatched-catch` shape without defstruct.
- `error/finally-value-discarded` — `(try 42 (finally 0))` → 42.
- `error/finally-after-catch` — catch result survives finally.
- `error/finally-unmatched-rethrow` — identity through a finally boundary:
  inner unmatched class, finally runs, outer catch binds the original 41.
- `error/finally-error-replaces` — `(try 1 (finally (throw 2)))`:
  `:error-category "thrown"`.
- `error/recur-through-try` — catch-only try in a loop tail: 3.
- `error/throw-arity` — `:error-category "throw arity"`.
- Compile-error pins (`:compile-error`): clause-after-clause-body ordering,
  non-symbol class, non-symbol name, `recur cannot cross a finally
  boundary`.

The core-language corpus cases that use `defstruct`/`def`/`set!`
(`error/catch-order`, `error/finally-normal`, `error/finally-unwind`) stay
out of the VM corpus: namespaces and mutation remain outside the supported
subset, and `ex-info` is a std.foundation function the VM cannot call yet.
They are claimed by the namespace-aware milestone, not this one.

### 18.10 Open decisions recorded at milestone 3

- Static try table instead of a dynamic handler stack (§18.1) — recur and
  branch exits through protected ranges need no runtime bookkeeping;
  revisit only if the frame-stack milestone wants one unwind mechanism for
  both errors and suspension.
- Error identity stays in `core.rs` (§18.0) — the machine reuses the side
  channel; a future value-carrying error representation would change both
  evaluators together.
- `recur` across `finally` rejected (§18.6) — accepted divergence; the
  frame-stack milestone owns the general protocol.
- Malformed catch clauses rejected at compile time (§18.5) — the evaluator
  only inspects clauses on the throwing path and then treats non-symbol
  classes as non-matching; VM rejection is canonical.
- Finally semantics follow the fiber evaluator (§18.3) — the sync
  fallback's last-error-wins behavior is not reproduced.

## 19. Milestone 4 — globals, namespaces, and arity (issue #223)

Milestone 4 lets the VM see the shared namespace environment. Until now
every program was closed: names were lexical slots, the ten shared
primitives, or same-program `defn` slots, and an unknown symbol was a
compile error. Real programs read foundation vars (`count`, `inc`),
define their own globals (`def`, `defn`), mutate them (`set!`), and
raise structured errors (`defstruct`). This milestone compiles those
without changing the closed-program behavior: a program compiled
against an empty registry behaves exactly as before.

### 19.0 What changed underneath since milestone 1

The namespace machinery this builds on is not the one milestone 1
described (`Rc<RefCell<HashMap<String, Value>>>` environments). The
runtime now has `kernel::NamespaceRegistry<core::Value>`
(`rust/src/kernel/namespace.rs`): namespaces hold `Var<Value>` mappings
with identity (`requalify`/`same_identity`), origins
(`VarOrigin::{Source, HalFallback, RustLibrary, RuntimePrimitive}`),
metadata (`VarMetadata` with hara flags, doc, arglists), aliases and
lazy aliases, load states, and module revisions. `Var`/`VarMetadata`/
`VarOrigin` live in `rust/src/kernel/var.rs`. The flat env HashMap and
the `save_namespace`/`refresh_qualified_bindings` bridge still exist —
for the tree evaluator. The VM does not join that bridge (§19.3).

### 19.1 Globals model: registry-direct, no env bridge

The evaluator's `def` interns into a flat per-eval env and
`save_namespace` requalifies and moves entries into the registry
afterwards; `refresh_qualified_bindings` then rebuilds the env from
every mapping in every namespace. That save/refresh cycle runs after
every top-level form and is one of the costs listed in issue #195.

The VM talks to the registry directly:

- `DefGlobal` interns a `Var` into `registry.current()` with the
  qualified name from the start — nothing to requalify, nothing to
  save, nothing to refresh.
- `GetGlobal` resolves through `NamespaceRegistry::resolve` at
  execution time (current namespace, aliases, qualified names), which
  is also what gives the VM foundation vars: `refer_foundation_into`
  has already mapped them into `user`, so `(count ...)` compiles to an
  ordinary global load plus `Call`.
- `SetGlobal` resolves the var and `reset_value`s it; `VarGlobal`
  (`#'x` / `(var x)`) pushes the `Value::Var` itself.

There is no snapshot/restore, no env cloning, and no qualified-name
materialization on the VM path. A failed execution leaves successfully
interned vars in place — the same observable state the evaluator
produces after `save_namespace`.

**Evaluator convergence (var-cell fix).** The registry-direct model
exposed a pre-existing tree-evaluator defect: fresh `def`/`defn` cells
were created with bare (unqualified) symbols, so they failed
`binding_is_local` and redefinition within one eval shadowed with a
fresh cell (early binding), while cells that survived an eval's
save-back came back qualified and were reset in place (late binding) —
the answer depended on the Runtime's history. The JVM runtime always
resets the same cell (`(= v1 (var f))` → `true`,
`(do (defn f [x] 1) (defn g [] (f 0)) (defn f [x] 2) (g))` → `2`, and
displays `#'user/f`). The evaluator now creates local cells qualified
from the start (`local_var_name` in `core.rs`), converging on the JVM
semantics on both first and later evals; var display is qualified
(`#'user/rank`), matching `HaraVar.display`. Two observable effects:
the conformance `:defn/redefinition-captured` case now pins the
canonical `2`. Foundation names are now protected referrals; local
replacement is expressed by namespace omission or `:require :exclude`,
not by `declare`. The VM's
planned `VarGlobal` unqualified-display requalification is dropped —
display is qualified on every path.

### 19.2 Compile-time visibility vs runtime resolution

Two-phase name checking, because `def` and use can be in the same
program:

- The compiler tracks **program-declared globals**: names introduced by
  top-level `declare`, `def`, `defn`, `defstruct` in the same source.
- It also queries the registry it was compiled against for
  **pre-existing globals** (foundation vars, earlier defs).
- Resolution order is lexical slot, visible global, then primitive fallback.
  An unqualified symbol in none of those categories stays the milestone-1 compile error
  `unbound symbol: {name}` — closed-program behavior is unchanged, and
  typos are still caught at compile time.
- A visible global compiles to `GetGlobal`, which resolves **at
  runtime**. Same-program `def`-then-use works (the `DefGlobal` runs
  first), and a var redefined or removed between compile and execute
  resolves to the current value or fails at runtime — matching the
  evaluator, which also detects unbound globals at runtime.
- Qualified symbols (`a/b`) always compile to `GetGlobal` with runtime
  resolution: alias loading and namespace lifecycle are runtime
  concerns (`force_lazy_alias`, load-failure retention) that the
  compiler must not pre-empt.

Compilation takes a registry reference (`compile_source_with`); the
milestone-1 `compile_source` compiles against an empty registry, so the
entire existing corpus and its compile-error expectations stand.

### 19.3 New instructions

```rust
GetGlobal(u32),                       // constants[i] is the name string
DefGlobal { name: u32, metadata: Option<u32> },
SetGlobal(u32),
VarGlobal(u32),
DefStruct { name: u32, fields: u32 }, // constants: name, string vector
StructField(u32),                     // constants[i] is the field keyword
InstanceOf,                           // (instance? Type value)
MakeMultiArity(u8),                   // build a dispatcher from N functions
```

All name operands index the constant pool (names are `Value::String`;
the validator checks the constant kind). `DefGlobal`'s optional
metadata constant is a literal map value assembled at compile time
(`^:private`, doc strings, attr maps, computed `:arglists`) — the VM
does not need map-literal construction for this because metadata maps
are closed literals embedded as constants.

`MakeMultiArity` pops N function values and pushes a dispatcher built
through the same `core::multi_arity_function`/`select_clause` the
evaluator's `defn` uses: exact fixed-arity match first, then the
variadic clause with the most parameters, otherwise
`{name} has no arity accepting {n} arguments`. VM closures are native
`Value::Function`s (§17), so the existing dispatcher wraps them
unchanged and arity errors phrase identically on both paths.

### 19.4 defn becomes a real var; defn lowering is superseded

Milestone 2 lowered top-level `defn` to direct slot bindings because
there were no globals. With `DefGlobal`, top-level `defn` interns a
var: value, doc/arglists/attr-map/private metadata (the
`:definition/*` corpus cases read them through `#'` + `meta`), and
`defn-` as private. References and self-recursive calls compile to
`GetGlobal` + `Call` — through the var, like the evaluator, so
redefinition between compile and execute is observed. `CallStatic`
stays in the instruction set (the validator still knows it) but the
compiler no longer emits it; the milestone-2 lowering corpus cases keep
their displayed values, so they pass unchanged.

The issue-#202 ruling is superseded at the global layer. Referred Vars are
protected for every definition/mutation form; `declare` is forward visibility
only. A local definition requires a blank namespace, omission, or explicit
`:require :exclude`.

### 19.5 defstruct, field, instance?

`DefStruct` executes the same construction the evaluator's special form
performs (`core.rs` defstruct arm), extracted behind a registry-based
helper: validate name/fields, create the `StructType` qualified to the
current namespace, intern the three vars (`Name`, `->Name`,
`map->Name`). Trailing protocol clauses are a compile error
(`defstruct protocol clauses are not supported`) — protocol extension
is a later milestone, and the `protocol/*` corpus cases stay there.

`field` and `instance?` compile to `StructField`/`InstanceOf`, which
call extracted core helpers (`struct_field`, `struct_instance_of`) so
positional field lookup and `Rc::ptr_eq` type identity live in exactly
one place. This completes the catch-class story from milestone 3:
`catch_matches` already matches struct type names with the `/{class}`
suffix rule, so the four core-language error cases deferred from #203
(`error/catch-order`, `error/unmatched-catch`, `error/finally-normal`,
`error/finally-unwind`) now run verbatim.

### 19.6 Variadic and multi-arity functions

- `FunctionPrototype` gains `variadic: bool`. Params `[a b & rest]`
  compile with arity 2 and the flag; at call time the machine requires
  at least `arity` arguments and binds the remainder into a
  `Value::List` in the rest slot, matching `call_function`
  (`core.rs:7500-7582`). Applies to `fn`, `defn`, and closure calls.
- Multi-arity `defn` compiles each clause body as its own prototype
  (each may be variadic) and combines them with `MakeMultiArity`
  (§19.3) before `DefGlobal`. Bare multi-arity `fn` stays a compile
  error — the evaluator's `fn` arm does not accept it either
  (`core.rs:8282-8299`); only `defn`/`defn-` do.

### 19.7 Runtime entry points and the host boundary

New `Runtime` methods (feature-gated):

```rust
Runtime::compile_bytecode(&self, source)      // compiles against self's registry
Runtime::eval_bytecode_native(&mut self, src) // compile + execute against self's registry
```

The free functions (`compile_bytecode`, `execute_bytecode`,
`eval_bytecode_native`) keep compiling closed programs against an empty
registry.

`ns`, `require`, `in-ns`, `alias`, `refer`, `use` remain compile errors
in the VM. Namespace selection and module loading are the host
boundary: `Runtime::eval_forms` already intercepts top-level `ns`/
`require` before evaluation, and that interception is where a future
default-VM world routes them — the VM never grows module-loading
instructions. `set!` targets globals only; the evaluator's promotion of
a lexical local into a var (`binding_var`, `core.rs:7443-7453`) is not
reproduced — `set!` on a lexical name is a compile error
(`set! targets a global var`). `binding`/`^:dynamic` is deferred (it is
a frame-adjacent push/pop protocol; the `runtime/dynamic-binding`
corpus case moves with it).

### 19.8 Validation additions

- Global instruction name operands index a `Value::String` constant
  (kind-checked); `DefStruct` fields index a vector constant of
  strings; `DefGlobal` metadata indexes a map constant when present.
- `MakeMultiArity(n)` pops exactly `n`, pushes 1; every popped value is
  a function (runtime-checked; the validator checks the height).
- Stack effects: `GetGlobal`/`VarGlobal` +1; `SetGlobal` pops 1 pushes
  1; `DefGlobal` pops 1 pushes 1 (def returns the value); `DefStruct`
  pops 0 pushes 1 (returns the type value); `StructField` pops 1
  pushes 1; `InstanceOf` pops 2 pushes 1.
- Variadic prototypes: `arity` counts fixed params; calls to variadic
  prototypes are valid with `argc >= arity` (fixed prototypes still
  require `argc == arity`).

### 19.9 Deferred with the milestone

- `binding` / `^:dynamic` (`runtime/dynamic-binding` corpus case).
- `defstruct` protocol clauses, `extend-type` (`protocol/*` cases).
- Protocol-based metadata access on structs (`runtime/metadata`).
- `ns`/`require`/`in-ns`/`alias`/`refer`/`use` compilation
  (`module/*`, `namespace/config-*` cases) — host boundary, §19.7.
- Destructuring parameters.

### 19.10 Open decisions recorded at milestone 4

- Registry-direct globals instead of joining the save/refresh env
  bridge (§19.1) — the bridge exists to serve the tree evaluator's flat
  env; the VM never had one, so joining it would import the cost
  without buying parity.
- Global references resolve at runtime, visibility checked at compile
  time (§19.2) — preserves both the closed-program compile errors and
  def-then-use within one program.
- defn self-calls through the var, not `CallStatic` (§19.4) — parity
  with redefinition semantics beats the static-call saving at this
  stage; benchmarks will say if it matters.
- Metadata maps as constants (§19.3) — avoids growing map-literal
  instructions for a compile-time-known value.
